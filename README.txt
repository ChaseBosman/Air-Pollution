Application created by Chase Bosman - https://github.com/ChaseBosman.

This application provides users with current statistics regarding air quality. Users also have the ability to
calculate their current pollution contributions. The project uses a REST API through aqicn.org to retrieve current statistics. 
Code is managed through a jenkins pipeline to automate testing with jUnit. A building stage is also present. 

Code is executed/ran through controller.py.
