Application created by Chase Bosman - https://github.com/ChaseBosman.

All code should adhere to PEP8 standards.

This application provides users with current statistics regarding air quality. Users also have the ability to
calculate their current carbon footprint through the application. The project utilizes geolocation through aqicn.org's REST API to retrieve current pollution
statistics. 

Code is managed through a jenkins pipeline to automate testing with nose and xUnit. A build stage is also present. 

Code is ran through main_window__select.py.
