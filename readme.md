## Air Quality App
### All code should adhere to PEP8 standards.

#### This application provides users with current statistics regarding air quality in their local area. Users also have the ability to calculate their current carbon footprint through the application. The project utilizes geolocation through aqicn.org's REST API to retrieve current pollution statistics.
#### Features a jenkins pipeline to automate testing with nose and xUnit. A build stage is also present. 

### Code is ran through main_window__select.py.

#### Thanks!
